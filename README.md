## Dataset
Previous intent detection datasets such as Web Apps, Ask Ubuntu, the Chatbot Corpus or SNIPS are limited to small number of classes (<10), which oversimplifies the intent detection task and does not emulate the true environment of commercial systems. Although there exist large scale multi-domain datasets (HWU64 and CLINC150), the examples per each domain may not sufficiently capture the full complexity of each domain as encountered "in the wild". The Banking77 dataset tries to fill the gap and provides a very fine-grained set of intents in a single-domain i.e. banking. It consists of 77 classes.
